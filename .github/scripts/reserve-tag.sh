#  reserve-tag.sh — pick the next image revision and reserve its git tag.
#
#  Every published image gets a permanent name flutter-X.Y.Z.R (Flutter release
#  X.Y.Z, image revision R). R is the first number that is free in BOTH places
#  that must agree:
#    * Docker Hub: no image with that tag exists (checked anonymously, the
#      repository is public), and
#    * GitHub: the git tag can be created. GitHub refuses it when the tag already
#      exists, or when the name was used by an immutable release: such a name stays
#      reserved for good, even after the release and its tag were deleted.
#
#  The tag is created here, before anything is pushed to Docker Hub, so the image
#  and the release that follows can never disagree about a name. A failed run can
#  leave an unused tag behind, which only costs one number.
#
#  Inputs (environment): IMAGE (Docker Hub repository), FLUTTER_VERSION, GH_REPO,
#  TARGET_SHA, GH_TOKEN (for gh); optional MAX_REVISION (default 99).
#  Outputs (GITHUB_OUTPUT, when set): tag, number.
